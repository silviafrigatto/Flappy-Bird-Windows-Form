# Flappy-Bird-Windows-Form
This Flappy Bird game was the first project that I made from scratch on Windows Forms. My goal was to become more familiar with the C# language and develop my logic and problem solving skills related to game development.

I used Moo ICT's tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUCCv-sFUDQ) as a reference, but I also added my own features to the game:

- A "best score" system;
- An enemy;
- Start/ending menu screens;
